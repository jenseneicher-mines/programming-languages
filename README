Setup Instructions
==================

1. Form teams of 3-4 students.  You may create a corresponding github
   team in the course organization.

2. Clone this repo.

3. Create a new, private repo for your team in the course
   organization.  Name your repo `TYY-team-TEAMNAME`, where,
   - `T` is one charcter for the term: `f` Fall or `s` for Spring,
   - `YY` is the two digit year, e.g. `19` for 2019,
   - `TEAMNAME` is a name for your team.

4. Give all team members access to the team repo in the course github
   organization.

5. Add all team members' names and CWIDs to the `AUTHORS` file.

6. Change the remote for your cloned repo to your newly created team
   repo and push.

7. Double-check that (1) your team's github repo is correctly named
   and (2) only your teammates (and the instructor/TA) can access your
   team's github repo.


Submission Instructions
=======================

These submission instructions are intended to promote collaboration
with your teammates, make submitting your code easy, and avoid errors
with incorrect submissions.  Please take care to correctly submit your
work by the deadline.

- Push all changes to your team repo created above in the course
  organization before the deadline.

- The TA/instructor will clone the user repos (based on the repository
  name prefix) at the deadline and grade the code in the master
  branch.

- ONLY CODE THAT IS CORRECTLY SUBMITTED BY THE DEADLINE WILL BE
  GRADED:
  - Ensure that your code is pushed to a correctly named repo in the
    course organization.  Incorrectly named repos will not be graded.
  - Ensure that your code is in the master branch.  Code in other
    branches will not be graded.
  - Submit your code by the deadline.  Late work will not be graded.
  - Keep the same directory structure and function names as in the
    stater code.  The grading scripts will test your code based on the
    directory structure and function names in the starter code.  If
    you change either, your code will not pass the tests, and you will
    not receive credit.
  - Code that does not compile will not receive credit.
